Overview of my Project

Objective: Your Student Management System is a C++ console-based application for managing student records. It supports basic CRUD operations and includes the following features:

Add Student: Input ID, name, and marks. Grades are calculated automatically based on marks.
Edit Student: Modify student details by ID and update the grade.
Delete Student: Remove a student record using their ID.
Display All Students: Show all stored records with ID, name, marks, and grade.
Exit: Close the application.

Implementation Highlights
Structure: Student structure holds ID, name, marks, and grade.
Class: StudentManagementSystem encapsulates all operations, storing data in a vector for dynamic management.
Grade Calculation: Grades are assigned based on marks (A-F scale).
Interface: A menu-driven loop in main() handles user choices.

Strengths
Modular, encapsulated design.
Dynamic storage using vectors.
User-friendly error handling for invalid operations.

Suggested Improvements
Input validation for better user experience.
Sorting and searching capabilities.
Persistent storage using file I/O.
Enhanced grade customization.
This project demonstrates solid OOP principles and provides a strong foundation for further enhancements.
